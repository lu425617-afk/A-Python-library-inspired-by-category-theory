# A Python Library Inspired by Category Theory

This repository contains a Python library that implements core categorical structures and concepts such as functors, limits, colimits, monoidal categories, natural transformations, and diagrammatic reasoning.

The project is designed for educational and research purposes, particularly for those exploring the intersection between abstract algebra, functional programming, and machine learning architectures.

## ✨ Features

- Abstract constructs: Category, Functor, Equalizer, Pullback, Pushout, Limit, Colimit
- Monoidal, strict monoidal, and symmetric monoidal categories
- Categorical interpretation of neural architectures (e.g., CycleGAN module)
- Support for visualizing categorical diagrams and transformations
- Modular design for extensibility and integration with symbolic computing
